/**
 * Left-ventricular myocardial segments of a point of LV compact myocardium (decision 152), in the heart frame: azimuth
 * atan2(y, x) with 0 = lateral and π/2 = anterior, and the level fraction (z − zAnn) / (L − zAnn) from the mitral annulus
 * (0) to the end of the LV cavity (1; the endocardial apex stays at z = L through the cycle).
 *
 * Both are material in this model: the ventricle shortens along its axis with the apex fixed and thickens radially
 * without torsion, so a point of tissue keeps its azimuth and its level fraction through the cycle (its material
 * coordinates are the same numbers scaled back to end-diastole; `lvSegments.test.ts` follows material points).
 *
 * Clinical rules (AHA 2002; ASE/EACVI 2015): the anterior and inferior right-ventricular insertions bound the septum —
 * anterior (1, 7) | anteroseptal (2, 8) at the anterior one, inferoseptal (3, 9) | inferior (4, 10) at the inferior one
 * — and the six basal and mid segments are 60° each; the apical level has four segments centred on the anterior, septal,
 * inferior and lateral walls; the long axis is divided into basal, mid and apical thirds; the apex (17) is the
 * myocardium beyond the end of the cavity. Model choices: the insertions are the model's interventricular grooves
 * (`RV_GROOVE_ANTERIOR_RAD`, `RV_GROOVE_INFERIOR_RAD`), 2.1 rad (120.3°) apart; the boundaries are the septal centre
 * midway between them ± 60°, within 0.2° of each groove, so that the septum holds exactly two segments; equal thirds of the current annulus–cavity length (the model's papillary tips and bases lie at 0.40 and 0.68
 * of it, not at the thirds); half-open intervals, the lower bound belonging to the next segment clockwise.
 *
 * One code carries two models: 1–16 are the AHA segments; 17–20 are the apical cap in the quadrant of apical segment
 * 13, 14, 15 or 16. AHA 17 reads 17–20 as 17; the 16-segment wall-motion model reads them as 13–16, so its four apical
 * segments cover the whole apex (it is not the 17-segment volume with the cap removed). 0 = not LV compact myocardium.
 * This function is translated to GLSL (`npm run glsl:gen`): the CPU and GPU tracers share its boundaries.
